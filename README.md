# secure-chatroom
## Overview
A chat app demonstrating the importance of encryption, authentication, and attack prevention through secure and insecure versions.
This project aims to implement security principles to develop a secure chat application that protects against these threats. Additionally, the project will demonstrate the vulnerabilities of insecure applications to educate users on the importance of security.

## Objectives and Scope
# Objectives:
Develop a secure chat application using encryption and authentication
Create a version where only simple security features are implemented to demonstrate vulnerabilities and how each security feature covers otherâ€™s vulnerabilities
Vulnerability Examples: Man-In-The-Middle, Message Tampering, Spoofing
# Scope:
The focus will be on web-based or command-line interface
Not a mobile or desktop app
It will strictly be a text-based chat
No files, images, etc


## Features
- Secure messaging with AES/RSA
- Login system
- MITM, Spoofing, and Tampering attack simulations
